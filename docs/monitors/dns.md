# DNS

The DNS monitor resolves a hostname and determines whether or not the host is reachable based on whether or not the name resolves.

The monitor has the following options.

| Name | Description | Required |
| :--: | :---------: | :------: |
| `hostname` | The host to ping | Yes |
| `interval` | The time to wait between each ping | No. Defaults to 1s |
